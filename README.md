# simun-eqns

This Repository contains three C programs to find the root of the simultaneous equations using Gauss Elimination Method, Gauss Seidal Method, and Jacobi's Method.

I have tried to design and implement the most eaisest and far less complex method for the purpose.

This was made as a part of a school Micro-Project.
